in the form of Word documents. These will be written by XCIST's primary developers but will be stored in the repository, so others can revise if they wish. The fourth category, "[Tips and Tricks](https://github.com/xcist/code/documentation/Tips-and-Tricks)", will be Wiki pages that can be quickly written by anyone.

#### [User manual - for users, by developers](https://github.com/xcist/documentation/UserManual)
This will be a relatively high-level manual directed at users who aren't concerned about how XCIST works "under the hood". This will focus on how to use XCIST's existing features. By necessity, some high-level discussion of the imaging system will be included but detailed discussion of imaging physics and XCIST's algorithms and implementation is found in other documents (below).

#### [Theory and Implementation - for advanced users and developers, by developers](https://github.com/xcist/documentation/TheoryAndImplementation)
This will be an in-depth manual directed at advanced users and developers. This will focus on imaging physics and XCIST's algorithms and implementation of those algorithms.

#### [Software design - for developers, by developers](https://github.com/xcist/documentation/SoftwareDesign)
This will be a detailed manual directed at developers who want to revise existing code or add new features and functionality.

#### [Tips and tricks - for users and developers, by users and developers](https://github.com/xcist/documentation/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks)
This is intended as a mechanism for anyone to make quick notes for themselves or others to refer to. These are Wiki pages and therefore can be produced and revised quickly and informally.
