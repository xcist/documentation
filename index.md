Welcome to XCIST: X-ray-based Cancer Imaging Toolkit
XCIST will provide the ability to simulate X-ray/CT images of virtual patients (with or without tumors). These images will accurately represent images that would be produced by a real scanner.

XCIST will include three primary groups of components:

Simulation components, including physics-based models of scanner hardware and physical processes
Imaging subjects (phantoms) including geometric objects and numerical anthropomorphic phantoms (virtual patients) with or without tumors
Image reconstruction
XCIST will be downloadable as a straighforward, ready-to-use, GUI-driven Python application that will run under both Linux and Windows. (The compute-intensive work will be done in run-time-linked binary libraries.) To perform a simulation, users will need to have Python installed. Then, using either our GUI or simple configuration files, you will simply need to

Select an imaging system configuration from a pre-defined standard system with or without variations based on several available component models (or advanced users can develop their own models).
Select a scan protocol from several pre-defined protocols and multiple user-selectable variations such as kVp, mA, rotation time, focal spot, bowtie, etc.
Select simulation options from several pre-defined configurations and multiple user-selectable variations including oversampling, with or without quantum and/or electronic noise, etc.
Select a subject to be scanned (i.e a numerical phantom) from a rich library of geometric phantoms and virtual patient models with and without tumors (or advanced users can develop their own phantoms).
Select a reconstruction algorithm from several pre-defined options (or advanced users can develop their own reconstruction).
Launch your simulation.
Review the results! (available as simple binary files and/or in DICOM format)
