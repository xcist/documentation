## Welcome to XCIST: X-ray-based Cancer Imaging Toolkit

XCIST will provide the ability to simulate X-ray/CT images of virtual patients (with or without tumors). These images will accurately represent images that would be produced by a real scanner.

XCIST will include three primary groups of components:
- Simulation components, including physics-based models of scanner hardware and physical processes
- Imaging subjects (phantoms) including geometric objects and numerical anthropomorphic phantoms (virtual patients) with or without tumors
- Image reconstruction
